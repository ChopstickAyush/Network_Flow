This code is developed and maintained by Ayush Agarwal(210050029) as a self-project in the summer of the academic year 2023-24, inspired by Rohit Gurjar, a professor in CSE department of IIT BOMBAY.

In graph theory, a flow network (also known as a transportation network) is a directed graph where each edge has a capacity and each edge receives a flow. The amount of flow on an edge cannot exceed the capacity of the edge. Given this definition, our work is to find the maximum amount of flow that can be sent from a given source node s to a sink node t which obeys the constraints. Here, I have implemented a 
residual-graph algorithm to solve it. In general many problems can be reduced to network flow and also many theorems can be proven using it like Hall's theorem etc. The future work will involve using the network flow to make solutions for other problems like dividing poset into minimum number of chains etc.
